  Changed the rtraingle and qtriangle functions in response to an excellent bug
  report from Dr Michael Scroggie (Michael.Scroggie@dse.vic.gov.au).  The bug
  involved the conditional logic in the inverse CDF so that when the "a" and "c"
  parameters were equal, rtriangle would return a vector of "a".

  triangle mode to be 1/2 of the base instead of 1/2 (or 10 for the log triangle)
  based on Randall Pruim's suggestion as well.
