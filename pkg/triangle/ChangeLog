  Changed the rtraingle and qtriangle functions in response to an excellent bug
  report from Dr Michael Scroggie (Michael.Scroggie@dse.vic.gov.au).  The bug
  involved the conditional logic in the inverse CDF so that when the "a" and "c"
  parameters were equal, rtriangle would return a vector of "a".

Version 0.4
  Changed the license to GPL >= 2 according to a Kurt Hornik email

Version 0.5
  Changed the filenames to be portable
  
Version 0.6 03/25/2009

Version 0.7
  Added the manual entry for the logarithmic triangle
  
Version 0.8
  Changed the arguments for dtriangle and dltriangle to be an "x" instead of a "q"
  based on a suggestion from Randall Pruim.  Also, changed the default for the
  triangle mode to be 1/2 of the base instead of 1/2 (or 10 for the log triangle)
  based on Randall Pruim's suggestion as well.

Version 0.9
  Updates to fix errors in the CRAN build.
  
Version 0.10
  Update to the description file
  
Version 0.11
  Update to dtriangle to fix a bug when a == c and x == c
