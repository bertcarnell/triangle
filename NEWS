Changes in version 0.1 (2006-10-20)

- Changed the rtraingle and qtriangle functions in response to an excellent bug
report from Dr Michael Scroggie (Michael.Scroggie@dse.vic.gov.au).  The bug
involved the conditional logic in the inverse CDF so that when the "a" and "c"
parameters were equal, rtriangle would return a vector of "a".

Changes in version 0.8

- Changed the arguments for dtriangle and dltriangle to be an "x" instead of a "q"
based on a suggestion from Randall Pruim.  Also, changed the default for the
triangle mode to be 1/2 of the base instead of 1/2 (or 10 for the log triangle)
based on Randall Pruim's suggestion as well.
